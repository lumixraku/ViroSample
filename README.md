# ViroSample

## How to run?
Official Version:
npm start
then open Viro Media App on your device, click `Enter Testbed` menu, input http://{YOUR_MACHINE_IP}:/8081

RN Version:
Run `./setup-ide.sh --android` in root path, then run `npx react-native start ` in one terminal,  run `npx react-native run-android`.
The rn start command would start a server listening on port 8081.


## RN prepare
upgrade Node to .12+
use `npx react-native` command not `react-native-cli`. (you should uninstall react-native-cli command first)
